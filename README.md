# React-Native Prototype

Evaluation Prototype for IMSmobile/app.  
Progress is tracked in [IMSmobile/app/issue/5](https://github.com/IMSmobile/app/issues/5)

## Setup
See [Install React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/getting-started.html)

As IDE I'll try out [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [React Native Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsmobile.vscode-react-native) extension.
